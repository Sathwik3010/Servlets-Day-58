what is servlet and in how many ways we are able to prepare Servlets in web applications ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

servlet is a server side program, by executing this server side program some response will be generated by the container and server to the respective client

Servlet is an Object maintained by the container and it must implement a "servlet" interface either directly or Indirectly 

As per the Servlet API provided predefined library there are 3 ways to prepare Servlets.

1. Implementing Servlet interface
----------------------------------
Servlet is an interface provided by Servlet API in the form of "Javax.servlet.Servlet" or "Jakaarta.servlet.Servlet" and it has following methods.

public interface Servlet{
public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException;
public void Service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException;
public ServletConfig getServletConfig();
public ServletConfig getServletInfo();
public void destroy();
}

from the above 5 methods the methods like init(),service(), destroy() are involved in Servlet lifecycle so these methods are called servlet "LifeCycle methods" the remaining methods like getServletConfig() and getServletInfo() method are called "non LifeCycle methods".

where the init() method will be executed when the container is performing Servlet Initialization. 

where the service() method will be executed when the container is performing request processing phase. 

where getServletConfig() method will return ServletConfig Object.

where the servletInfo() method is able to return some description about the servlet.

where the destroy method will be executed when the container performs Servlet Destination phase.

implementation of service() method
----------------------------------
service() method like main() method in J2SE application. it will have the application logic which we want to execute to process the request.

container will execute the service methods automatically  upon receiving request from clients because the container aware about() service() method implementation we have to use following steps.
method its application logic in the body.

in serive() method implementation we have to use following steps.

1. set contentType response in order to give information to the client about the type of response that present Servlet is generating.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.public void setContentType(String MIMEtype);
where the MIME type in web application is "text/htm", "img/jsp", "text/xml".

ex: response.setContentType("text/html");

2.get printWriter object from response Object inorder to send response to the Response Object and to the client.
public PrintWriter getWriter();
ex: PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();

3.send response to the response Object

out.println("<html>");
out.println("<body>");
out.println("Hello User");
out.println("</body>");
out.println("</html>");


2. Extending Generic Servlets 
3. Extending HttpServlet.
